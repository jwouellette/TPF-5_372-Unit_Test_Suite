# IFC Submittals

Vendors shall place IFC files in this folder. Naming for files shall be the name of the test with the vendor named and version appended. For example:  
> L1-Br01-AbutmentFooting01-Allplan-V1.ifc

If a file fails validation and checking, the vendor will be instructed to resubmit a new file with a new version number. Only the latest version should remain in the repository. Old versions should be removed.

When a file has passed validation and checking, the version will be changed to "FINAL". This version will be used by importing software to validate their support.
