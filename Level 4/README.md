# TPF-5_372-Unit_Test_Suite - Level 4 Instructions

The Level 4 test instructions concentrate on testing for the following concepts for each bridge design:

- Alignment and stationing 
- Benchmarks
- Geolocation / georeferencing
- Higher-level spatial structure
	- `IfcProject`
		- `IfcSite`
			- `IfcBridge`
				- `IfcBridgePart`
- IFC4.3 Project, Site, and Bridge attributes and properties
- Custom (AASHTO) Project, Site, and Bridge properties and property sets
- Document references to applicable design codes, manuals, guidelines, construction documentation, and specifications
- Person/Organization attribution for Engineer-of-Record and Owner

Requirements will only vary for specific bridge information or bridge type, as general IFC mapping and configurations, based on the bSI AbRV base MVD and proposed project IFC concept mappings, apply for all.
