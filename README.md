# TPF-5_372-Unit_Test_Suite
The Unit Test Suite (UTS) is the Test Instruction (.pdf, .csv/.xlsx, .ids) and IFC file repository (.ifc) for the BIM for Bridges and Structures Transportation Pooled Fund project https://bimforbridgesus.com/

The test instructions (TIs) provide information about the modeling of various bridge elements and whole bridges and their repsective IFC4.3.x schema mapping, as well as associated data/properties, for the Design-to-Construction exchange. The exchange is based on the bSI Alignment-based Reference View (AbRV), with content outlined:
- The official IFC4.3.2.0 documentation at [https://ifc43-docs.standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4x3/HTML/concepts/content.html](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4_3/index.html) and
- The offical AASHTO IDM at https://store.transportation.org/Item/CollectionDetail?ID=241.

If you have any questions, please use the [*Discussions*](https://github.com/jwouellette/TPF-5_372-Unit_Test_Suite/discussions) section of this repo. If you find problems/errors/issues with the TIs, please use the [*Issues*](https://github.com/jwouellette/TPF-5_372-Unit_Test_Suite/issues) section to submit an Issue. All relevant technical and implementation documentation can be found in the [*Wiki*](https://github.com/jwouellette/TPF-5_372-Unit_Test_Suite/wiki)
